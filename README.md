# Erlang Assignment 1 – p1 and p2

**Tracy Dang, Bennett Rakower, Megha Thumma  



## p1.erl

The **p1** module asks the user for a number and then performs differennt actions.
After completing the computations, the program terminates.


## p2.erl

The **p2** module performs the same computations as `p1`, but runs continuously. The loop terminates  when the user enters 0.

## testing

We were able to compile and test the files using different numbers, specifically 0 to see if the program terminates, hello to see if only integers were accepted, -2, 7, and 5, for example.
